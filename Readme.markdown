# Countdown

Coundown is a Mac OS X screen saver forked from [Motivation](https://github.com/soffes/Motivation). You can use it to countdown to any date you want. (If you pick a date in the past, it will count up from that date instead.)

You can configure the date once you picked it in Screen Saver Preferences in System Preferences.

## Installation

**[Download the latest release](https://github.com/zfdang/Countdown/releases).** Unzip and double-click.

If you see a message saying this screen saver doesn't work with this version of OS X and you have 10.11 or higher, just quit System Preferences and relaunch it. The screen savers is pretty buggy when it comes to screen savers written in Swift.

## Building

Xcode 10 is required to build Countdown since it's written in Swift 4.2.
